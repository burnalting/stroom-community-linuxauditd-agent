Synopsis:
========
The stroom_audit_agent is a lightweight auditing deployment that periodically collects events from the Linux auditd
sub-system and posts those events to a Stroom audit repository (web service). It is expected that
 - the system can resolve it's own hostname i.e the command "hostname --fqdn" returns the correct and expected value (localhost* is not acceptable)
 - the system has an appropriate ip address i.e. the command "hostname -I" returns the correct and expected value (127.0.0.1 is not acceptable)
 - the Linux auditd system has been set up appropriately and the resultant logging appears in /var/log/audit
 - the Stroom Audit System has been configured to accept streams of events into one of LINUX-AUDITD-AUSEARCH-V3-EVENTS or
   LINUX-AUDITD-AUSHAPE-V3-EVENTS feeds.
 - the audit authority has set up one or two destination web servers to post to. Change the string URL to identify multiple destinations
   to try

One can optionally specify a single file to collect audit from. This may be the case if one is sending auditd events via
say a syslog plugin (hopefully tcp) to a central host which holds auditd files for multiple hosts (as well as it's own).
Given you are not sending this central host's audit to itself one could deploy the complete package and then
add additional cron entries to collect audit from the aggregating locations. Such scripting is beyond the scope of this release
but fundamentally, given you have a structure like
  repository/
  repository/year/
  repository/year/month
  repository/year/month/day
  repository/year/month/day/hosta/auditd.log
  repository/year/month/day/hostb/auditd.log
  repository/year/month/day/hostc/auditd.log
  ...
  repository/year/month/day/hostN/auditd.log
  
one could run the main script with say
  stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -l repository/year/month/day/hosta/chkpt.txt -F repository/year/month/day/hosta/auditd.log -c repository/year/month/day/hosta/chkpt.txt
  stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -l repository/year/month/day/hostb/chkpt.txt -F repository/year/month/day/hostb/auditd.log -c repository/year/month/day/hostb/chkpt.txt
  stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -l repository/year/month/day/hostc/chkpt.txt -F repository/year/month/day/hostc/auditd.log -c repository/year/month/day/hostc/chkpt.txt
  ...
  stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -l repository/year/month/day/hostN/chkpt.txt -F repository/year/month/day/hostN/auditd.log -c repository/year/month/day/hostN/chkpt.txt

To orchestrate this a script would need to run through the repository, perhaps using the existence of the chkpt.txt file given you keep it
in the data directory. Use its existence (ie if not there, we have not processed data) and of the three times of the data file, checkpoint
file and the current time to see if we need to still run the command for that repository directory

Disconnected Transmission:
========================
In certain circumstances, a destination Stroom proxy will not be available. To facilitate this, the concept of a
'disconnect package file' has been introduced. In essence, the primary script, stroom_auditd_feeder.sh, can create
a 'disconnect package file' which is then moved to a host which can post to a Stroom proxy and that host can post
the file, whilst retaining all the metadata the script (stroom_auditd_feeder.sh) normally gathers and transmits.
This 'disconnect package file' holds both the original compress auditd processed output with a file suffix of .data
and a file containing metadata from the host forming the file. This metadata provides details such as the host's 
ip addresses, name server, storage detail, etc. The disconnect package file has the nomenclature
  E_auditProcessed.<randomvalue>.<creationtimestamp>.tar
and holds the files
  auditProcessed.<randomvalue>.<creationtimestamp>.gz.meta
  auditProcessed.<randomvalue>.<creationtimestamp>.gz.data



So, on the disconnected host, the steps would be
  - deploy as per normal, except change the cron entries within /etc/cron.d/stroom_auditd to have the additional argument, -P, to
    indicate that rather than post to a Stroom proxy, a disconnect package file is created in the outbound queue directory
    $STROOM_ROOT/queue.
  - collect the generated disconnected files from the outbound queue directory and transport them to the host that can
    post to a Stroom proxy

On, the connected host, the steps would be
  - deploy as per normal
  - create the disconnected inbound directory $STROOM_ROOT/disconnected. This CANNOT be the same as $STROOM_ROOT/queue
  - implement a process to deliver the disconnected files to $STROOM_ROOT/disconnected
  - modify the existing script execution in /etc/cron.d/stroom_auditd to change the max sleep to 5 minutes (300 seconds). i.e.
    add 
    -d 300
    to the script execution so it looks like (assuming $STROOM_ROOT is /opt/stroom/auditd)
        */10 * * * * root /opt/stroom/auditd/bin/stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -d 300 >> /var/log/stroom_auditd_auditing.log 2>&1
  - add an additional cron entry within stroom_auditd.crontab to have the additional arguments,
    -n -p $STROOM_ROOT/disconnected
    and offset it's execution by 6 minutes from the normal execution as per
        6-59/10 * * * * root /opt/stroom/auditd/bin/stroom_auditd_feeder.sh -n -p /opt/stroom/auditd/disconnected >> /var/log/stroom_auditd_auditing.log 2>&1

Storage Imposts:
===============
  - Deployment size of approx 40K - $STROOM_ROOT
  - Temporary storage of up to 8.00GB for a period of 90 days (given failure of web service) within $STROOM_ROOT. This is the default
    if you need to change this, then edit $STROOM_ROOT/bin/stroom_auditd_feeder.sh and change one or both of the
    FAILED_RETENTION and FAILED_MAX environment variables

Prerequisites:
=============
  - requires recent audit and audit-lib packages (more recent that release 2.4.0)
  - requires the bind-utils, coreutils, gawk, curl, net-tools, gzip and sed packages
  - optionally can use the aushape capability if installed. This utility can format auditd logs into XML. Details can be found in
    https://github.com/Scribery/aushape. The use of this utility will mean for more efficient processing by the central Stroom repository
    as it will not have to transform the line orientated ausearch -i output into XML

Capability Workflow:
===================
The workflow is such that, every 10 minutes cron starts a script which
  - delays randomly between 7 and 590 seconds before collecting audit data in order to balance network load. One does want many Linux
    systems 'pulsing' the network every 10 minutes. Note the 10 minute period is configurable. Just change the cron entry times as well
    as the max_sleep (-d argument). See stroom_auditd.crontab for more information
  - runs the ausearch command, using checkpoints, to collect all audit since ausearch's last invocation.
  - optionally run the aushape command to convert the ausearch output into XML
  - the resultant collected audit is gzip'd and saved in a file within a queue directory
  - all files in the queue directory are posted to the Stroom web service.

RPM Deployment:
==============

See the file README.rpmbuild on how to build a deployment rpm for el6 or el7 deployments. It has not
be tested in a long time, so some work may be needed.
