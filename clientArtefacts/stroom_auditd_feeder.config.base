# _AUDIT_ROOT_/config - Configuration file for stroom_auditd_feeder.sh script

# Use this file to override configuration environment variables in the stroom_auditd_feeder.sh script.
# Although any variable in the script, before the sourcing of this configuration file, can be overridden here,
# one would normally set the values for configuration items below.


# SYSTEM    - The system the Linux host is deployed within or type of Linux host.
#
# The default for this item will either be "LinuxServer" or "LinuxWorkstation" (if X11 present). Equally one could
# describe the complete system the capability resides within. For example
#
#   SYSTEM="Cross Domain Capability #1"

# ENVIRONMENT   - The system environment the host is deployed within. Can be one of "Production", "QualityAssurance",
#                 or "Development" 
#
# The default for this item is "Production". Clearly one can have other terms that suit one's organisational posture
#
#   ENVIRONMENT="Development"

# URL   - A comma separated list Stroom urls where the script is to post the audit log files to.

# The script will attempt to post the file to each url on the list until success or list exhaustion. This list is normally
# provided by the Audit Authority. For example, 
#
#   URL=https://stroom-proxy00.somedomain.org/stroom/datafeed,https://stroom-proxy07.somedomain.org/stroom/datafeed

# mySecZone - The 'Security zone' or environment of the capability.
#
# The default for this is "none". One could use this item to describe the security environment of where the host resides.
# Security zones normally indicate the sensitivity of the deployed capability. 
# 
#    mySecZone="Cross Domain Capability #1 High Side Zone"
